# CPP Modules 0 to 4 Project README

## Overview

The **CPP Modules 0 to 4** project is a comprehensive journey through the world of C++ in my 42 school curriculum. These modules cover fundamental to advanced concepts, including syntax, memory management, object-oriented programming, subtype polymorphism, and templates.

## What I Learned

Through the **CPP Modules 0 to 4**, I gained a diverse range of knowledge and skills, including:

1. **C++ Fundamentals**: I started with the basics of C++, including syntax, variables, data types, and the structure of C++ programs.

2. **Memory Management**: I learned about memory allocation and management, including dynamic memory allocation using new and delete operators.

3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: I explored the core principles of OOP, such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

4. **Subtype Polymorphism**: I delved into subtype polymorphism, working with abstract classes, interfaces, and pure virtual functions, as well as dynamic casting and type identification.

## Project Structure

The **CPP Modules 0 to 4** typically include practical coding exercises and projects that allow students to apply what they've learned in each module. It's a comprehensive introduction to C++ and its applications in object-oriented and generic programming.

## Usage

The skills and knowledge acquired through **CPP Modules 0 to 4** are invaluable for C++ programming, software development, and object-oriented design. These modules provide a solid foundation in C++ that can be applied to various programming projects and challenges.
